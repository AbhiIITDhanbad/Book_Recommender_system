# Book Recommender System

This repository hosts a book recommendation system designed to suggest books to users based on their preferences and reading history. The system leverages the power of machine learning to filter through a vast dataset of books and ratings, providing personalized recommendations that help users discover new reads they'll love.

The project primarily employs **Collaborative Filtering** to provide a robust and effective recommendation engine.

## ✨ Features

* **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides tailored book suggestions based on user interaction data.
* **Collaborative Filtering:** Identifies users with similar reading tastes and recommends books they have enjoyed.
* **Data Processing:** Includes scripts for cleaning, merging, and preparing raw book and user data for model training.
* **Intuitive Interface:** The system's output is easy to interpret, showing recommended books with relevant details.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python:** The core programming language for the project.
* **Data Manipulation & Analysis:**
    * **Pandas:** For efficient data loading, cleaning, and manipulation of datasets (e.g., books, ratings, users).
    * **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array processing.
* **Machine Learning & Algorithms:**
    * **Scikit-learn:** For implementing collaborative filtering algorithms, especially `cosine_similarity`.
* **Data Visualization:**
    * **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For visualizing data trends and model results.

## 🔄 Workflow

The recommendation process is implemented in a structured pipeline:

1.  **Data Acquisition:**
    * The system loads three key datasets: `Users`, `Books`, and `Ratings`.
    * `Users` contains user IDs and demographic information.
    * `Books` contains book metadata (ISBN, title, author, year of publication, etc.).
    * `Ratings` contains explicit ratings given by users to books.

2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * The datasets are cleaned to handle missing values and merged into a single, unified dataframe.
    * A user-item matrix (or pivot table) is created, where rows represent users and columns represent books, and the values are the ratings given by each user to each book. This matrix is often sparse, meaning most values are missing.

3.  **Model Implementation (Collaborative Filtering):**
    * The core of this system is the **Collaborative Filtering** model, which is implemented using **Cosine Similarity**.
    * For a given user, the model finds other users who have a similar taste in books.
    * The model then recommends books that these "similar" users have liked but the target user has not yet read.

4.  **Recommendation Generation:**
    * The model generates a list of recommended books based on the user's interaction history and the calculated similarities.
    * The results are presented to the user with details like the book title and author.

Here's a simplified representation of the workflow:

`User & Book Data -> Data Cleaning & Merging -> User-Item Matrix -> Cosine Similarity Calculation -> Top-N Recommendations`

### **Usage of Cosine Similarity**

Cosine Similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space. It is calculated as the cosine of the angle between the vectors, and its value ranges from -1 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (completely similar). In this project, it is used to find the "distance" between users' rating vectors.

The formula for Cosine Similarity between two vectors, $A$ and $B$, is:

$$ \text{Cosine Similarity}(A, B) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i B_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} B_i^2}} $$

In our context:

* **A and B** are the rating vectors of two different users.
* **The vector elements** ($A_i$ and $B_i$) are the ratings given by a user to each book.
* A similarity score close to 1 indicates that the two users have very similar rating patterns (i.e., they like and dislike similar books).
* A similarity score close to 0 indicates a low similarity.

By calculating the cosine similarity between the target user's rating vector and all other users' rating vectors, we can find the "nearest neighbors" in terms of reading taste.

## ⚙️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AbhiIITDhanbad/Book_Recommender_system.git](https://github.com/AbhiIITDhanbad/Book_Recommender_system.git)
    cd Book_Recommender_system
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Dataset:**
    * The project likely uses a public dataset, such as the **Book-Crossing Dataset**.
    * Make sure to download and place the `BX-Books.csv`, `BX-Users.csv`, and `BX-Book-Ratings.csv` (or similar files) in a `data/` directory within the repository.

## 🚀 Usage

### **Running the Recommender**

1.  **Pre-process the data and build the recommendation model:**
    ```bash
    # This command may vary depending on your script names
    python data_processing.py
    python model_training.py
    ```

2.  **Get recommendations for a user:**
    ```bash
    # This command will vary depending on how you've set up your recommendation script
    python recommend.py --user_id 12345
    ```
    Replace `12345` with the ID of the user you want to get recommendations for.
